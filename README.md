# Native Testing Library Sample

To modify the application, check out `src/App.js`. You will find basic example tests for that file at `src/__tests__/App.js`.

## Available commands

### `npm test`

To run the test suite, run `npm test`. There should be no additional setup required to run the tests, other than running
and `npm install` prior to the first run.

### `npm start`

To run the app in the iOS simulator, run the start command. Before running this, you will have to be sure you have followed
the [setup instructions]() provided by the React Native team.
